# Challenge automation framework

This is a Java-based automation framework for testing web applications using selenium and TestNG and RestAssured for api tests. It is built using Maven as a project management and build tool. This README file provides an overview of the framework, its features, and instructions for getting started.

## Features

- **Maven Project Structure:** The framework is structured as a Maven project, making it easy to manage dependencies and build the project.

- **TestNG Integration:** TestNG is used as the test framework, providing features like test parallelization, data-driven testing, and reporting.

- **WebDriver:** WebDriver is used for browser automation, allowing you to write tests for various web browsers.

- **Page Object Model (POM):** The framework follows the Page Object Model design pattern, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

- **Logging:** Logging is implemented using a logging framework (e.g., Log4j) to capture detailed test execution logs.

- **Reporting:** Test results are generated in HTML format using TestNG reports, making it easy to analyze test results.

- **Configuration Management:** Test configuration parameters (e.g., browser type, URLs) are managed in configuration files (e.g., properties files).

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
